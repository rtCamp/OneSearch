> **OneSearch** is a [OnePress](https://rtcamp.com/onepress/) ecosystem plugin that enables **cross-site, brand-aware search** across a multi-brand WordPress network. It powers unified discovery across sites, powered by [Algolia](https://algolia.com/).

---

## ðŸ§  What is OneSearch?

**OneSearch** is part of the **OnePress ecosystem**, designed to enable **cross-site search** across multi-brand WordPress networks.  
It centralizes the discovery process, allowing users to search and retrieve relevant content from multiple connected sites â€” from any site(s) in your brand network.

This plugin acts as the **backend engine** that powers the indexing, querying, brand network management, and filtering logic needed for federated search.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why OneSearch?

Managing content across multiple brands, regions, or business units often results in disconnected search experiences. This can lead to broken user journeys and lost discovery opportunities.

**OneSearch** solves this by enabling a **federated search layer** that bridges multiple sites, powered by [Algolia](https://algolia.com/) delivering a consistent and brand-respecting experience across the network.

### Benefits
- **Unified Search Layer:** Execute a single search query across multiple connected sites.
- **Brand Awareness:** Show source brand site and redirect user to the respective site.
- **Governance & Control:** Control visibility and indexing scope at the site or post-type level.
- **Developer Extensibility:** Easily register post types, taxonomies, and metadata for indexing.
- **Performance Optimized:** Lightweight REST architecture with cache-friendly responses.
- **Modular Design:** Extend and customize indexing and search behavior without core overrides.

## ðŸª„ Key Features

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### Does OneSearch support custom post types?
Yes, using OneSearch, you can index the default as well as custom post types.

#### Do I need to manually index a newly published post?
As long as the post type is included in the configured entities, new posts are automatically indexed.

#### Are updates to an already indexed post automatically handled?
Yes. Any updates made to a post are automatically synced with the Algolia index.

#### How are the search results ranked?
Search results are ranked by Algolia's relevance algorithm. However, OneSearch boosts results from the current site you're searching on, ensuring more relevant local content appears first.
